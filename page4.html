                    <li><strong>Ripple: Marketing and Adoption</strong>- Ripple is already in action, able to process 1000 transactions per second. The're logo is is simple, and honestly doesn't matter very much. The work they have done to deal with banks rather than against them in a time of financial upheaval has given them incredible support by tradtional banking systems. Ben Bernanke was at the last major conference for Ripple. Branding at this point is irrellavant.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stellar:</strong> <strong>Marketing and Adoption </strong>- Stellar still feels, well, immature. Their logo and website have a nice look, but it feels cheap compared to Ripple. Ripple has the advantage of being around longer, so their domininance may have something to do with it, but it doesn't give Stellar any points here. Stellar also lags behind in adoption. Additionally, the adoption we've seen comes in the form of a low quality photo of a guy using an old computer looking to be scanning a foreign currency into a fax machine. They boasted this as a major accomplishment. It felt cheap. Stellar still has a long way to go. But their relationship with IBM says alot about the expectations important people have for them. We imagine they must things we don't.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ripple: Tech and Utility</strong>&nbsp;- They have solved an issue that has plagued international banking since its inception. They have sped up the process, made it cheaper and took a bunch of pockets out of the line that you have to pay to convert money. Its a huge solution. And they work with the banks instead of against them. They are however not decentralized and their coins aren't mined. If you take a look at their specs, they appear to be the anti bitcoin. Everything that bitcoin has set out to do, Ripple has done the opposite.</li><li><strong>Stellar: Tech and Utility</strong> - Stellar feels like a carbon copy of Ripple for another niche which promises more work and less benefit. They are a non for profit and have stated that many of their billions of coins will be given away. What do you think that will do to the price?</li>
                    <li><strong>Criticisms</strong>&nbsp;- Both of these coins are premined, which of course raises a lot of red flags for the crypto community, especially when you find out that the companies &nbsp;hold huge amounts of the coin for themselves. Additionally, their billions of circualting coins do nothing for increasing demand. Ripple works with the banks, which makes them thefeds are far as many of us are concerned. Stellar seems to be idealistic with how it will distribute coins to the world. It puts a mountain of an objective in front of it and has left much of its work in obscurity.&nbsp;</li>

                   Something has bugged me since I first starting researching and investing in these two currencies. As great of a value that they added to the banking infrastructure of the world I could never put my finger on what gave their coin value. If they were converting to different currencies, say USD to EURO, what was the utlity of the Ripple's XRP and Stellar's Lumen? <br><br>From all that I can see they have none. Both organizations require that you have a small amount of their currency ($100 in XRP/ 20 Lumens) which are used to pay for transfer fees. But you still need to deposit the currency you wish to convert. So you don't use their native currency to actually make the transfer. You are still using fiat.&nbsp;<br><br>IBM is working with Stellar and their technology hyperledger to create a faster more secure and less expensive payment system. But they never say anything about their native coin, Lumen.&nbsp;<br><br>Essentially, with a little additonal code, they could do away with the coins altogether and provide a service like any other company. The truth is, they are not cryptocurrencies at all, in any way. They are not banking revolutions, they are banking solutions. Which is great! But they should be listed on the NYSE and go through the work of an IPO, instead of being in the cryptoworld. Both companies hold billions of dollars on a coin that has no clear utility in the long run.&nbsp;<br><br>We may be missing something, but it appears that their coins are simple shares of stock, masquerading as cryptocoins. It's a great technology which provides value to the world. But they are no cryptocurrencies. We score them equally at 0 unless someone can provide us with an explanation to what value their coins hold.</p>
