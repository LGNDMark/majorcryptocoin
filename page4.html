The're logo is is simple, and honestly doesn't matter very much. The work they have done to deal with banks rather than against them in a time of financial upheaval has given them incredible support by tradtional banking systems. Ben Bernanke was at the last major conference for Ripple. Branding at this point is irrellavant.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>&nbsp;Tech and Utility</strong>&nbsp;- They have solved an issue that has plagued international banking since its inception. They have sped up the process, made it cheaper and took a bunch of pockets out of the line that you have to pay to convert money. It's a huge solution. And they work with the banks instead of against them. They are, however, not decentralized and their coins aren't mined. If you take a look at their specs, they appear to be the anti-bitcoin. Everything that bitcoin has set out to do, Ripple has done the opposite.</li><li><strong>Criticisms </strong>-&nbsp;I need a bigger box.</li>

                   Something has bugged me since I first starting researching and investing in this currency. As great of a value that it has added to traditional banking infrastructure, I haven't been able to put my finger on what gives the native coin (XRP) value. If the Ripple protocol converts one fiat currency to another, say USD to EURO, what is the utility of the Ripple's XRP? <br><br>I never really got my answer. What I found was that you are required to put $100 in XRP on their platform in order to use it. <br><br><strong>But!</strong><br> <br>To make a cross border payment, you also need to deposit the fiat currecy you wished to send. XRP ends up being used to pay for fees. But what prevents me from just paying with my fiat that I additionally have to deposit anyway? XRP isn't used in the payment. It just sits in the account taking an arbitrary task. Its almost as if it was an after thought.<br><br>Essentially, with a little additonal code, they could do away with the coin altogether and provide a service like any other company. The truth is, it is not a cryptocurrencies at all. They are not part of the banking revolution, they are a traditional banking solution. Which is great! But they should be listed on the NYSE and go through the work of an IPO, instead of calling themselves a cryptocurrency.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe I'm missing something, but it appears that their coins are simply shares of stock, masquerading as cryptocoins. It's a great technology which provides value to the world.<strong> But Ripple is no cryptocurrency.</strong><br><br>And it doesn't stop there. The companies owners hold half of the coin supply, which isn't 'in circulation'. So everyone who is invested in Ripple could at any time have the value of their share cut in half it it were to be released to the public. They are also a centralized company which works with traditional banking using a premined coin which has no proof of work, stake or any other system which empowers people.&nbsp;<br><br>They are eveything that currency has been for the last 50 years which inspired peer to peer block chain in the first part. Most people in the cryptoworld hate them. And honestly, it's for good reason. They are being honest with people.<br><br>That is why a gave them a score of zero.<br><br>It's very possible I have missed something. But that is part of why I wrote this article. I exhuasted my understanding of this situation. I hope that someone else can clear this up for me. I will gladly amend this article if the information is presented to do so. So please, let us know if we have made a mistake. Othewise, Don't HODL this one for too long.</p>
